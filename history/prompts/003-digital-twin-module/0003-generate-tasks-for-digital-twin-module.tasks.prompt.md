## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have created the tasks file for the new feature "Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)".
The tasks file is located at `/mnt/d/AIDD-hackathon-book/AI-robotics/specs/003-digital-twin-module/tasks.md`.

You can now review the tasks and, if everything is correct, you can proceed with the implementation by running `/sp.implement`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a new tasks file for "Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)".
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 1 file was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement`
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating a new tasks file is well-defined and the `check-prerequisites.sh` script is very helpful.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
