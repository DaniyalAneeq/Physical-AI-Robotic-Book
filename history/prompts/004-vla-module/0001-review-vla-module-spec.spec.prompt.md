## Prompt

Ok I've 001-vla-module/spec.md. Review it and update in the history. Then we will proceed to sp.plan

## Response snapshot

I have reviewed `specs/001-vla-module/spec.md`. It is a detailed specification for 'Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)', covering its scope, chapter structure, content requirements, a capstone project, and success criteria for a Docusaurus-based textbook.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Reviewed the spec file and created a PHR entry.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Reviewed one file.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to `/sp.plan`
- 🧠 Reflection: The `create-phr.sh` script successfully created the file, but it needs to be populated with content.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Use `/sp.plan` to generate the plan.
