# Chapter 1: Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to the exciting world of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models! In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of VLA and its significance in modern robotics.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the core concepts of VLA.
- Appreciate the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with robotic systems.
- Recognize the current challenges and opportunities in the field of VLA.

## Key Concepts

- **VLA Definition**: We will define what a VLA model is and how it differs from traditional robotic control systems.
- **History**: A brief look at the evolution of VLA models.
- **LLMs in Robotics**: How LLMs are revolutionizing the way we interact with and control robots.
- **Multimodal Perception**: The importance of combining different sensor modalities, like vision and language.

## Practical Hands-on Tasks

This chapter will guide you through setting up a basic Python environment for the VLA experiments in the upcoming chapters.
