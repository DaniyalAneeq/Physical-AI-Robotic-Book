# Chapter 4: Vision-Grounded Action Understanding

This chapter focuses on integrating multimodal perception models for grounded object recognition and contextual understanding.

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate multimodal perception models for grounded object recognition.
- Enable robots to act based on visual information.
- Understand the concept of "grounding" language to visual entities.

## Key Concepts

- **Multimodal LLMs**: Using LLMs that can process both text and images.
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: A brief introduction to Vision Transformers.
- **Object Detection APIs**: Using pre-trained models for object detection.
- **Semantic Mapping**: Building a map of the environment with semantic information.

## Practical Hands-on Tasks

We will use a simple vision model to identify objects in a simulated environment and integrate this visual feedback into the LLM planning loop.
