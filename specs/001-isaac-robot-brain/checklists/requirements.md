# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](specs/001-isaac-robot-brain/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The specification includes implementation details (e.g., specific APIs, languages, frameworks, Docusaurus) as explicitly requested by the user in the initial prompt for generating the textbook module specification. This deviates from a strictly technology-agnostic spec but aligns with the user's direct instructions.
- The target audience is inherently technical (students/researchers in AI and robotics), so the spec's technical depth is appropriate for this context, even though it would be considered 'technical' for a general non-technical stakeholder.

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
